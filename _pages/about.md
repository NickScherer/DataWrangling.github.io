Iâ€™m an aspiring data scientist, experienced with Python programming. I specialize in machine learning techniques, and data wrangling. I love working on projects together, so feel free to reach out for collaboration!

Before I was mainly [SAP Solution Architect S/4 HANA](https://www.spc4erp.com). 
Am still operating on both side, depending where I get a project earlier.
(AI/ML) - Training I have done since April 2019.
